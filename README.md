## Folder Structure

- **dataset**: currently holds the small evaluation dataset that we use to test the performance of LLMs. In the future, it will hold a larger evaluation dataset and links to a modern UI screenshot and icon dataset.
- **itutor-demo**: source code for our project page, containing a static demo of iTutor's algorithm.
- **itutor-system**: development folder for iTutor system. It contains a web-based tech demo that could be run on your computer. The system uses ChatGLM from Zhipu AI, so you should prepare an API key.
